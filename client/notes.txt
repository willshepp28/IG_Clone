ANGULAR FILES




e2e ( end to end )
 is where we write end to end test on our application. These are basically automated test to simulate a real user.

node_modules
- third party libraries that our application may depend on.

src
- this is where we have the actual source code to our application

assets
- where you store the static assets of our application (text, font, image , icon file)






FYI
- every application has one module and one component
